# COVID-19-SEIR-LSTM
This project implements the prediction of the 2019 novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19), using the classic infectious disease dynamics model SEIR to change the degree of intervention by controlling the contact rate, reflecting the significance of prevention and control.

In addition, the LSTM neural network is used to achieve a certain degree of prediction, input the data of the first three days, and predict the data of the fourth day. The next step is to add intervention values as input, optimize the sequence length of input and output, and better achieve prediction.

SEIR and LSTM prediction of the epidemics trend of COVID-19.
